# Learning goals

* Learning React for the frontend, and creating a well isolated and smooth user interface using the best practices.
* Learn to create a well-designed and extensible backend architecture using microservices, that can serve any type of client (web, mobile, etc) and work with any type of database using ORM.

# Focus
* Simple but fully functional MVP frontend using React components
    * Register/Login/Edit Profile/Recovery for accounts
    * View/Create/Join/Invite to organizations
    * Informational pages (About/Contact/View Profiles)
    * View/Create/Join/Invite to groups
    * View/Write Review
* Fully functional MVP backend
    * Provide back-end services for all outlined front-end pages (i.e. serving data from database, handling authentication and so on).
    * Simple matchmaking algorithm that is separate from all the controller logic and can be easily swapped and\or adjusted.
* Simple data-layer using MongoDB

We will not focus much on the admin UI, the only feature we will create is to manage/create/delete the roles of other admins and instructors.
