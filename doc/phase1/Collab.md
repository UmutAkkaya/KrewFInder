Our team is mostly versed in backend development, but several people have expressed interest in learning frontend technologies (in particular, React).

# Meetings:
* Initial team meeting:
    * Discussed the scope of the project and everyone's learning goals
    * Determined the scope of this project to be the MVP, where not all possible features would be implemented, but those that are would be complete and implemented properly.

* Second team meeting (Online, Feb 10th)
    * Agreed on technologies to be used, tentative work assignment (frontend, backend, database, algorithms), application architecture (components, middleware, etc)
    *  Written out outline of P1 document

We plan to continue our meetings online due to the convenience and time conservation of this method. We will use after class time for in-person meetings if necessary.

# Shared Documents:

We use Google Docs\OneDrive for sharing our documents, as we don't need explicit version control for them, and we don’t want to make commits for every minor revision.

# Development Philosophy

We plan to use Kanban philosophy for developing this project. Kanban provides the lowest overhead for development, given that our team has strong work ethics. The idea is that people can simply pick tasks from the “todo” column and complete them within reasonable amount of time. We plan to use Projects on github to manage our tasks (similar to Trello, but with better GitHub integration).

We plan to synchronize our progress with periodic meetings to set our milestones as a group and decide what needs to be on the “todo” column for the next milestone.

# Work Separation

Everyone can pick a task from a suitable category (described in architecture.md). This allows individuals to focus on their area of expertise, while having freedom to work on something they enjoy or want to learn more. We will rely on work ethics to ensure that the amount of work is balanced fairly.

We have people who have experience and are willing to perform additional tasks, such as CI, repo man and so on. Code reviews will be performed by different people within their domain of expertise (i.e. any front end or back end person can review PRs within their corresponding area).

# Technical Collaboration

We will use git for source control with one branch per feature and pull request with code review before merging. PR submitter is responsible for the code being clean, tested and mergeable with master, and PRs aren’t merged until they meet such standards. Exceptions can be made for small commits that are guaranteed to work (i.e. amend README).

# Communication Protocols

We plan to use Facebook char for fast communication. All other communication will be performed using relevant tools. For example, feature documentation and specification will be performed in github issues (along with relevant discussion). Work discussion will be performed in related pull requests, design artifacts will be stored in Google Docs\OneDrive with appropriate discussion via comments.

# Progress tracking

We will use built in GitHub tools for progress tracking. Namely, we will use milestones for tracking big leaps and Kanban tasks for tracking progress between them, since individual tasks will be assigned to a milestone.
