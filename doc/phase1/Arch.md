# Backend
* C# and .NET for backend
* Provide endpoints that serve JSON in response to HTTP requests

# Frontend
* React for frontend
* Use single page application philosophy
* Asynchronous communication with backend

# Algorithms middleware
* Matchmaking algorithms should be easily swappable
* Models, backend and frontend should be agnostic of the matchmaking algorithm and vice versa
